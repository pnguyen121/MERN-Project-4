# Project Description:

This project serves to allow users to create a refined version of the Nike SNKRS release calendar.
Release calendars are extremely important for staying up to date with the latest sneaker drops.
Users can pull directly from Nike and create a calendar including only the shoes they wish to be displayed.
Sneaker card headers used for displaying shoes will have links to more details to prevent clutter.

*Whether you're a collector, botting, or just want a better way to stay in the loop regarding sneaker drops, this project has you covered!*

# Getting Started - User Guide:

1. Upon visiting the website you'll be met with a login / signup screen. If you don't have an account already just make one to enjoy the awesome features!
2. Once you're logged in, you'll be met with what we refer to as "sneaker cards". There are buttons that can be used for adding / deleting the cards as desired. 
3. By clicking on a sneaker card's header you can view more information regarding that particular shoe that is pulled directly from Nike.
4. Upon adding sneakers and sneaker images, you will automatically be redirected to your "feed page" where all of your sneakers appear!
5. Admins can add sneakers to other user's calendars in order to keep them up to date. This allows for groups of users to stay up to date with the same drops!
6. Calendars can be shared and sneaker cards can be liked by other users.

*Enjoy creating custom sneaker release calendars / collections portfolios! Feel free to make suggestions regarding new features or changes to the site!*
